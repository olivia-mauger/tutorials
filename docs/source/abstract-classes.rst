Abstract Classes
----------------

Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^

Drawing heavily on inheritance principles discussed in the previous section, we will now cover ``abstract`` **classes**. An ``abstract`` class is defined as a class that is able to have ``abstract`` methods. 

What do we mean by ``abstract``? Similar to interfaces, if a method is declared to be ``abstract``, no method body is provided, and the method header ends in a semi-colon. Any classes that extend an ``abstract`` **class** *must* provide implementation for every ``abstract`` method in the parent class.  However, not every method has to be ``abstract``. Child classes of an ``abstract`` class also inherit **concrete** (implemented) methods that can be, but do not have to be, overridden. 

How do we create an ``abstract`` class? It’s simple. ``abstract class ClassName`` is the proper syntax. Making an abstract method is similar: ``public abstract methodName() => ();``. You will get a compile error if you try to provide implementation for an ``abstract`` method. 

Now that we have covered *how* to create an ``abstract`` class, it also important to understand *why* we use ``abstract`` classes, and *how* they are different from interfaces. 

In general, programming is about **abstraction**, meaning the goal is to write loosely coupled code that works in multiple places. ``abstract`` classes help us to achieve that end, as ``abstract`` methods provide a general framework that subclasses are forced to implement. 

In addition, ``abstract`` classes are different from interfaces for a couple of reasons. For one, a class may extend only one ``abstract`` class, but it can implement numerous interfaces. Interfaces are **not** allowed to provide default implementation for their methods, but ``abstract`` classes can for any concrete methods.

.. note:: Interfaces and ``abstract`` classes do share something in common: you can not instantiate either using the keyword ``create``. 

Take a look at the example below to see how an ``abstract`` **class** works. 

Example
^^^^^^^^

The first class is ``Automobile``, the abstract class. 

.. code-block:: shadow 
    :linenos: 
 
    import shadow:io@Console;

    abstract class tutorials:absclass@Automobile
    {
        get String type; 
	get set int year; 
	get set int miles; 
	get double price; 
	
	public create(String t, int y, int m, double p)
	{
	    type = t; 
	    year = y; 
	    miles = m; 
	    price = p; 
	}
	
	public abstract takeATrip(int mph) => (); 
	
	public buyAuto(double offer) => () 
	{
	    if ( (price - offer) <= 1000 )
	    {
	        Console.printLine("Your offer is accepted! The " # type # " is yours!"); 
	    }
	    else 
	    {
		Console.printLine("Sorry, your offer is too low"); 
	    }
		
	} 
    }

The second is ``Motorcycle``, which extends ``Automobile``. 


.. code-block:: shadow 
    :linenos: 

    import shadow:io@Console;

    class tutorials:absclassMotorcycle is Automobile
    {
	
        public create(String t, int y, int m, double p)
        {
            super(t, y, m, p);  
        }
	
        public takeATrip(int mph) => ()
        {
	    Console.printLine("Buckle Up!"); 
	    Console.printLine("Your " # this->type # " is going " # mph); 
	}

    }

Lastly, here is an excerpt from the brief driver class, ``AutoDriver``, and the console output. 


.. code-block:: shadow 
    :linenos:

    Motorcycle harley = Motorcycle:create("Motorcycle", 2012, 8000, 30000.50); 
    harley.buyAuto(29500.50);  
    harley.takeATrip(75);  


.. code-block:: console

    Your offer is accepted! The Motorcycle is yours!
    Buckle Up!
    Your Motorcycle is going 75 mph 
    

 
First, before we get into any explanations, take a few minutes and examine the three classes above. See if you can trace through the driver program and predict the output without looking ahead. 

Now that you have a general idea how the program works, we will first touch on the ``abstract`` class ``Automobile``. Aside from the word ``abstract`` in the class header and the ``abstract`` method ``takeATrip()`` , ``Automobile does not appear to be any different than the classes we have studied previously. It still has a constructor, member variables, and one concrete method, ``buyAuto()``. 

The second class, ``Motorcycle``, extends ``Automobile``, as you can tell from the keyword ``is`` in the class header. ``Motorcycle`` does not override ``buyAuto()``, but it must provide default implementation for ``takeATrip()``, as seen in **Lines 11-15**. Notice how in **Line 8** we use the ``super()`` call to invoke the ``Automobile`` constructor. Using ``super()`` was covered in a previous section called "Implementation" under the page on "Inheritance". 

Lastly, the driver program should not look any different from any of the examples we have used thus far. We have created a ``Motorcycle`` object and called methods on it. However, it is important to note we could have declared ``harley`` like this as well:  

.. code-block:: shadow 

    Automobile harley = Motorcycle:create("Motorcycle", 2012, 8000, 30000.50); 


Here, the **type** of the variable ``harley`` is ``Automobile``, but it is still an instance of the ``Motorcycle`` class. You would get a compile error if you tried to write ``Automobile:create``.
